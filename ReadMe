rgit: a choose to store repositories based on git to take fewer storage 
and to do statistics more easily

To use this, you need to change path in rgit/rgitmod/index/repoPath into 
your path to store rgit infos

1.target:
	storing large amount of repositories with fewer storage
	providing interfaces to access statistics of OSS data more easily

2.needed:
	python, git

3.rgit format

(1)based on the format of git-repository

(2)transfer objects to specific position to manage objects from different
	objects together

(3)new directory .rgit, and some files in it to store related info

4.function for now:

(1)cmd: python main.py --init path/to/new_repo
intro: init directory path/to/new_repo into rgit format, and rgit will 
store related info in some files

(2)cmd: python main.py --absorb path/to/git_repo
intro: change git repository path/to/git_repo into rgit format, and 
transfer the git objects into specific directories(in rgit/rgitmod/index/repoList)

(3)cmd: python main.py --recover path/to/recover_git_repo
intro: recover a rgit repository into git repository
but now, it can just recover the directory which used to be a git repository

todo:
 (1)Increase the efficiency of absorb. Now, it takes more than 10 minutes to 
 absorb an 82.3MB repository(redis).
 
 (2)Complete the function recover. Now, it can just recover git repository into 
 directory which used to be a git repository.
 
 (3)Support commit on rgit repository.
 
 (4)Support update rgit reposiroty with new-version git reposiroty
